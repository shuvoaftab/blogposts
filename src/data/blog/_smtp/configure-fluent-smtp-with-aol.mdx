Setting up reliable email delivery from your WordPress site is crucial for ensuring that important notifications, password resets, and contact form submissions reach your users’ inboxes. FluentSMTP is a popular WordPress plugin that lets you connect your site to various email providers using SMTP, improving deliverability and reducing the chances of emails being marked as spam. This guide will walk you through configuring FluentSMTP with your AOL email account. By following these steps, you’ll be able to send emails from your WordPress site using your AOL address, leveraging secure authentication and best practices for optimal results.

This guide helps you configure your AOL email (**you@aol.com**) with the FluentSMTP plugin to send emails from WordPress. If you’ve reviewed the [Configuring Gmail with FluentSMTP](../configure-gmail-with-fluent-smtp/) guide, this will feel familiar.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring FluentSMTP with AOL, ensure you have:

- **AOL Email Address**: An existing email like **you@aol.com**.
- **AOL App Password**: A generated app password from AOL.
- **Administrative Permission**: WordPress Administrator role access.
- **Firewall Status**: Port 587 open.
- **TLS Support**: Server support for TLS v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, or v1.3.

## Configuring FluentSMTP with AOL

Connecting FluentSMTP with your AOL email account allows WordPress to send emails reliably using AOL’s SMTP servers. This process involves obtaining your AOL email address, generating an app password, configuring the FluentSMTP plugin with the correct SMTP settings, and testing the connection to ensure successful delivery.

Follow these steps to set up FluentSMTP with AOL:

### Step 1: Obtain AOL Email Address

Use your AOL email address, e.g., **ibrahim@aol.com**.

### Step 2: Generate an App Password

AOL requires an app-specific password:

1. Visit [AOL Account Security](https://login.aol.com/account/security?lang=en-US).
2. Click **Generate and Manage app passwords**.
3. Name the app (e.g., “FluentSMTP Guide”).
4. Copy the generated password.

### Step 3: Create a FluentSMTP Connection

In WordPress, create a new FluentSMTP connection:

1. Go to FluentSMTP settings.
2. Select **Other** as the connection method.

### Step 4: Enter Connection Details

Configure with these settings:

| Field             | Value                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| From Email        | Your AOL email (e.g., **ibrahim@aol.com**) |
| From Name         | Your preferred name (e.g., “Ibrahim Sharif”) |
| SMTP Host         | `smtp.aol.com`                         |
| SMTP Port         | `587`                                  |
| Encryption        | TLS                                    |
| Auto TLS          | Yes                                    |
| Authentication    | Yes (store keys in the database)       |
| SMTP Username     | Your AOL email (e.g., **ibrahim@aol.com**) |
| SMTP Password     | The app password generated earlier      |

### Step 5: Test the Connection

Test the configuration:

1. Go to **FluentSMTP > Email Test**.
2. Set **From** to your AOL email.
3. Choose a recipient email.
4. Enable HTML to avoid spam filters.
5. Click **Send Test Email** and check the recipient’s inbox.

## Best Practices

- **Cronjob Configuration**: Use a system cronjob instead of WordPress’s PHP-based cronjob for reliable email sending.
- **Spam Prevention**: Optimize IP reputation, domain reputation, and email content to avoid spam folders.
- **Use a Unique From Address**: Always use a consistent and recognizable "From" email address to build sender reputation.
- **Monitor Email Logs**: Regularly check FluentSMTP’s email logs for delivery issues or bounces.
- **Keep Plugins Updated**: Ensure FluentSMTP and all related plugins are up to date for security and compatibility.
- **Limit Outbound Volume**: Avoid sending large volumes of emails at once to prevent throttling or blacklisting.
- **Test Regularly**: Periodically send test emails to verify that your configuration is still working as expected.

## FAQ

- **Can I use my regular AOL password instead of an app password?**  
  No, AOL requires an app-specific password for SMTP connections. Your regular AOL password will not work for FluentSMTP.

- **What should I do if test emails are not delivered?**  
  Check your SMTP settings, ensure the app password is correct, and verify that your server allows outbound connections on port 587. Also, check your spam folder.

- **Is it safe to store SMTP credentials in WordPress?**  
  FluentSMTP stores credentials securely in the database, but always keep your WordPress installation updated and use strong passwords for your admin account.

- **Can I use SSL instead of TLS?**  
  AOL recommends using TLS on port 587. SSL on port 465 may not work reliably with AOL’s SMTP servers.

- **Will this affect my AOL inbox or regular email usage?**  
  No, configuring FluentSMTP with an app password only allows WordPress to send emails via your AOL account. Your regular email usage remains unaffected.
