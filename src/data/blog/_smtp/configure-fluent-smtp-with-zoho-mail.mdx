Zoho Mail is a popular cloud-based email service known for its robust security, user-friendly interface, and reliable performance, making it a preferred choice for businesses and individuals alike. When it comes to sending emails from your WordPress site, using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) ensures that your messages are delivered securely and reliably, reducing the chances of emails ending up in spam folders. Integrating Zoho Mail with WordPress via SMTP not only improves email deliverability but also allows you to leverage Zoho’s advanced features for all your site’s outgoing emails. This guide will walk you through configuring Zoho Mail with the Fluent SMTP plugin for WordPress.

The goal of this tutorial is to send emails from WordPress using your Personal Zoho Mail Email **_@zohomail.com_** by using the Fluent SMTP Plugin. If you have checked or reviewed my other article about [Configuring Gmail with Fluent SMTP](/posts/configure-gmail-with-fluent-smtp/) you will find it easier to follow this guide.

### Test the Connection

Now it's time to test the connection if it's working or not! Go to Fluent SMTP > Email Test:  
1. Use the From as your Zoho Mail email is just configured.  
2. Send To where you want to receive the test email.  
3. HTML should be turned on to avoid suspicious activity from Spam Filters.
