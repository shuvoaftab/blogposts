Yahoo Mail is one of the most widely used email services, offering robust security and reliable delivery for both personal and professional communication. However, when it comes to integrating Yahoo with third-party platforms like WordPress, sending emails directly from your site can be challenging due to strict authentication requirements. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) bridges this gap by allowing WordPress to send emails securely through your Yahoo account. By configuring Fluent SMTP with Yahoo, you ensure that your websiteâ€™s emails are delivered reliably, reducing the chances of messages being marked as spam or failing to send altogether.

The goal of this tutorial is to send emails from WordPress using your Personal Yahoo Email **you_@yahoo.com_** by using the Fluent SMTP Plugin. If you have checked or reviewed my other article about [Configuring Gmail with Fluent SMTP](/posts/configure-gmail-with-fluent-smtp/) you will find it easier to follow this guide.

## The Procedure to Configure Fluent SMTP with Yahoo

### Grab the Yahoo Email Address

Let's assume our target Email Address to be configured is **ibrahim@yahoo.com**.

### Generate an app password

Yahoo requires a different password rather than the account password like Gmail, Outlook, and Zoho Mail. Please visit: [https://login.yahoo.com/account/security#less-secure-apps](https://login.yahoo.com/account/security#less-secure-apps) and create a new app password which we will be using inside Fluent SMTP settings

**Click on Generate and Manage app passwords.**

![Yahoo generate app password page](@/assets/images/posts/fluentsmtp/fluent_smtp_yahoo_generate_app_password.png)

**Give a name for the app. Here I used Fluent SMTP Guide**

**Now copy the generated password.**

### Create a new Fluent SMTP Connection

Now it's time to configure Fluent SMTP. Create a new SMTP Connection and the method is **Other**.

### Put necessary details

| Setting           | Value/Description                                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **From Email**    | The Yahoo email address **ibrahim@yahoo.com**                         |
| **From Name**     | The name you want to use (e.g., **Ibrahim Sharif**)                   |
| **SMTP Host**     | **smtp.mail.yahoo.com**                                               |
| **SMTP Port**     | **465**                                                               |
| **Encryption**    | **SSL**                                                               |
| **Auto TLS**      | Yes                                                                   |
| **Authentication**| Yes. It's better to store the access keys in the database.            |
| **SMTP Username** | The Yahoo email address **ibrahim@yahoo.com**                         |
| **SMTP Password** | The **generated app password** we created earlier.                    |

### Test the Connection

Now it's time to test the connection if it's working or not! Go to Fluent SMTP > Email Test:  
1. Use the From as your Yahoo email is just configured.  
2. Send To where you want to receive the test email.  
3. HTML should be turned on to avoid suspicious activity by Spam Filters.

![Fluent SMTP test email sent successfully (generic screenshot)](@/assets/images/posts/fluentsmtp/fluent_smtp_gmail_test_sent_success.png)

Now click Send Test Email and check the destination Email Address.

![Test email received from Yahoo via Fluent SMTP](@/assets/images/posts/fluentsmtp/fluent_smtp_yahoo_received.png)

In this case, the test email is received and we are done configuring the Yahoo Email address to send WordPress emails using the Fluent SMTP Plugin.

## Things to Avoid When Configuring Fluent SMTP with Yahoo

When setting up Fluent SMTP with your Yahoo account, keep these common pitfalls in mind to ensure a smooth and secure configuration:

1. **Using Your Regular Yahoo Password**  
  Never use your main Yahoo account password in the SMTP settings. Always generate and use an app-specific password for enhanced security and to avoid authentication errors.

2. **Incorrect SMTP Server or Port**  
  Double-check that you are using the correct SMTP server (`smtp.mail.yahoo.com`) and port (`465` for SSL). Using the wrong server or port will prevent emails from being sent.

3. **Disabling Encryption**  
  Avoid disabling SSL/TLS encryption. Sending emails without encryption exposes your credentials and email content to potential interception.

4. **Entering the Wrong Email Address**  
  Make sure the "From Email" and "SMTP Username" fields match your actual Yahoo email address. Typos or mismatches can cause authentication failures.

5. **Ignoring Firewall or Hosting Restrictions**  
  Ensure that your hosting provider allows outbound connections on port 465. Some hosts block SMTP ports by default, which can block email delivery.

6. **Leaving Simulation Mode Enabled**  
  After testing, disable any simulation modes in Fluent SMTP to prevent sensitive information from being exposed in your logs.
