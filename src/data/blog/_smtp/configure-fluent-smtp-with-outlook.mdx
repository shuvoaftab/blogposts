The goal of this tutorial is to send emails from WordPress using your Personal Outlook Email **_@outlook.com_** by using the Fluent SMTP Plugin. If you have checked or reviewed my other article about [Configuring Gmail with Fluent SMTP](../configure-gmail-with-fluent-smtp/) you will find it easier to follow this guide.

### Keypoints Of Necessary Details

| Setting           | Value/Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **From Email**    | The Outlook email address **ibrahim@outlook.com**                                |
| **From Name**     | The name you want to use (e.g., **Ibrahim Sharif**)                              |
| **SMTP Host**     | smtp-mail.outlook.com                                                            |
| **SMTP Port**     | 587                                                                              |
| **Encryption**    | TLS                                                                              |
| **Auto TLS**      | Yes                                                                              |
| **Authentication**| Yes. It's better to store the access keys in the database.                       |
| **SMTP Username** | The Outlook email address **ibrahim@outlook.com**                                |
| **SMTP Password** | Email password: **I2X22AZ21**                                                    |

### Test the Connection

Now it's time to test the connection if it's working or not! Go to Fluent SMTP > Email Test:  
\-> Use the From as your Outlook email is just configured.  
\-> Send To where you want to receive the test email.  
\-> HTML should be turned on to avoid suspicious activity by Spam Filters.

Now click Send Test Email and check the destination Email Address.

In this case, the test email is received and we are done configuring the Outlook Email address to send WordPress emails using the Fluent SMTP Plugin.

## Important Note

It is highly recommended to configure a cronjob replacing WordPress's Default PHP-based Cronjob to operate Email sending and other scheduled jobs smoothly.  
Some hosting may not allow running a cronjob below 5 Minutes. But it is still better than a PHP-Based cronjob.

Emails landing in Spam Folders depend on numerous factors including IP reputation, Domain reputation, and Email Body Content.
