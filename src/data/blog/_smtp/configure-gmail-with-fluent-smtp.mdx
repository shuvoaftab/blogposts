### Keypoints of necessary details

| Setting           | Value                                                                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **From Email**    | The Gmail email address **ibrahim@gmail.com**                                           |
| **From Name**     | The name you want to use. Example: **Ibrahim Sharif**                                   |
| **SMTP Host**     | smtp.gmail.com                                                                          |
| **SMTP Port**     | 465                                                                                     |
| **Encryption**    | SSL                                                                                     |

| **Authentication**| Yes. It's better to store the access keys in the database.                              |
| **SMTP Username** | The Gmail email address **ibrahim@gmail.com**                                           |
| **SMTP Password** | Email password: **I2X22AZ21**                                                           |

### Test the Connection

Now it's time to test the connection if it's working or not! Go to Fluent SMTP > Email Test:  
\-> Use the From as your Gmail email is just configured.  
\-> Send To where you want to receive the test email.  
\-> HTML should be turned on to avoid suspicious activity by Spam Filters.

![Fluent SMTP Gmail test email sent successfully](@/assets/images/posts/fluentsmtp/fluent_smtp_gmail_test_sent_success.png)

Now click Send Test Email and check the destination Email Address.

In this case, the test email is received and we are done configuring the Gmail Email address to send WordPress emails using the Fluent SMTP Plugin.

## Important Note

It is highly recommended to configure a cron job replacing WordPress's Default PHP-based Cron job to operate Email sending and other scheduled jobs smoothly.  
Some hosting may not allow running a cron job below 5 Minutes. But it is still better than a PHP-Based cron job.

Emails landing in Spam Folders depend on numerous factors including IP reputation, Domain reputation, and Email Body Content.
