If you're starting a blog or building a website and you've searched "WordPress," you've likely stumbled upon two very similar yet completely different platforms: WordPress.com and WordPress.org.

This often creates confusion, especially for beginners. Both platforms share the same name and core software, but they cater to different types of users with distinct features, flexibility, and responsibilities.

In this guide, we'll explore the real differences between WordPress.com and WordPress.org, when to use each, and how to choose the right one for your needs. Whether you're a blogger, business owner, or developer, this post will provide clarity, confidence, and direction.

## Table of Contents

## What is WordPress.com and WordPress.org?

### WordPress.org (The Self-Hosted Version)

WordPress.org is the free, open-source CMS that you install on your own web hosting. It offers full control, access to themes and plugins, and the ability to monetize freely.

* You need to buy hosting (e.g., SiteGround, Bluehost).
* You install WordPress software yourself (most hosts do this in 1-click).
* You're responsible for maintenance, backups, and security.

### WordPress.com (The Hosted Service)

WordPress.com is a managed hosting platform powered by the WordPress software. It's owned by Automattic (co-founded by WordPress creator Matt Mullenweg).

* You create a site on WordPress.com without buying hosting.
* Free and premium plans are available.
* Limited flexibility on lower-tier plans.

---

## Why the Confusion Exists

Because both platforms use the WordPress name and are built on the same CMS, many assume they are the same. However, they are hosted differently, offer different freedoms, and target different user groups.
