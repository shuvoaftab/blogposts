## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide with Examples

Here’s a comprehensive guide to starting your WordPress blog in 2025, based on insights from [WPBeginner](https://www.wpbeginner.com/start-a-wordpress-blog/) and [IsItWP](https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-start-a-blog-step-by-step/).

### Step 1: Choose Your Blog Niche
Your niche defines your blog’s focus. Pick something you’re passionate about and that has audience potential.
- **Tips**:
  - Ask: What do I love? Can I write about it regularly? Is there monetization potential?
  - Use tools like [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com) or [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com) to research popular topics.
- **Example**: For a fitness blog, choose “Home Workouts” to target a growing audience interested in accessible exercise routines.
- **Action**: List 5–10 niche ideas, score them for passion and profitability, and select one.

### Step 2: Select a Hosting Provider and Domain Name
You need a domain (e.g., yourblog.com) and hosting to store your site’s files.
- **Top Hosting Providers**:
  - **Bluehost**: Beginner-friendly, free domain, starting at $1.99/month ([Bluehost](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/)).

- **Steps**:
  1. Visit your chosen provider’s site (e.g., [Bluehost](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/)).
