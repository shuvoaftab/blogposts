As we know WordPress is the topmost Content Management System in the market. After its Initial release on May 27, 2003, it is being used by more than 60% of the total websites running on the Web. While working with any websites or even software either on the web or on the local computer there can be a lot of issues occurring and can incur loss either with time or financially. We will be exploring numerous ways to investigate various issues and identify them so that we can resolve and troubleshoot further.

## Table of Contents

## Enable Browser Console

The first step to check for an issue that occurred on any of the web pages and also some other details regarding the Webserver, Network, Architecture, and other factors that runs or operates the website is to enable the Browser Console and check for initial hints.

To do this, please use ****⌘ +**** **Option + J (on macOS), or **CTRL +**** **Shift + J (on Windows/Linux)** from the keyboard which will open the browser console in the same window or in a new window if you have detached the window earlier.

You can also open the Developer Tools by clicking anywhere on the web page and Clicking on Inspect as shown in the picture. The shortcut for this is ****⌘ +**** **Option + I (on macOS), or **CTRL +**** **Shift + I (on Windows/Linux)**. This opens up the Elements Tab and then you will need to switch to the Console Tab.

Browser Console in the same window looks similar to the below screenshot:

The Red box Indicates the **Console Tab** where there are other tabs present for different purposes. The blue box section contains the Console Logs where warnings, messages, and errors are logged and you can get a hint from here if there are any issues on the web page.

## Check for HTTP Headers

Another advanced way to check for hints is to check the HTTP Headers from the other tab called "**Network**". From this tab, we need to click on the base URL and then on the right pane Click on the **Headers tab**.

Developer Tools: Network Tab

### General Headers

The general section contains a few primary information about the website as described below:

- **Request URL:** The web page where the developer tools were opened. _Example: **https://www.google.com/**_

- **Request Method:** The HTTP Request Method. _Example: **GET**_

- **Status Code:** The HTTP status code. _Example: **200**_

- **Remote Address:** The IP address resolved the domain including the Port for HTTP or HTTPS. _Example: **142.250.206.164:443**_

- **Referrer Policy:** This header defines how much referrer information should be included with requests. _Example: **origin**_

There are various types of headers that are responses against the requests a browser made to the server to load the web page.

## Check Site Health from WordPress

WordPress website also has some reporting for site health that you should also check if there is an anomaly to regular behavior in the website.

### Site Health

To check site health from WordPress, please go to **Tools > Site Health** and it will show the Status Tab as shown below:

This status tab reports if there are any critical issues that the Administrator should look into or will recommend a few other options for Performance and Securities improvements.

### Info

This tab has some categories of information and each category reports different types of information. To look for information about the WordPress and Hosting environment we need to look for WordPress and Server details.
