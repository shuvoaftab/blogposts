## About Headless WordPress Site

A headless WordPress site leverages WordPress solely as a backend content management system (CMS), separating it entirely from the frontend presentation layer. Instead of using traditional WordPress themes to render pages, all content—such as posts, pages, media, and custom fields—is accessed via the WordPress REST API, which exposes this data as JSON.

This decoupled architecture allows developers to build the frontend using any technology or framework they prefer, such as React, Vue.js, Next.js, or even mobile apps. The frontend fetches content from the WordPress backend through API requests and is responsible for rendering, routing, and user interactions.

Key benefits of this approach include:
- **Flexibility**: Choose any frontend stack and design system.
- **Performance**: Modern frameworks and static site generators can deliver faster load times.
- **Multi-channel delivery**: Serve the same content to websites, mobile apps, or other platforms.
- **Enhanced security**: The WordPress admin and backend can be hidden from the public internet.

In summary, a headless WordPress site transforms WordPress into a powerful, API-driven content hub, enabling modern, scalable, and highly customizable digital experiences.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Headless WordPress Site

Let’s build a simple headless WordPress site with a React frontend that fetches and displays blog posts via the REST API. This hands-on walkthrough will guide you through each step, from setting up your WordPress backend to deploying a modern React-powered frontend. 

By the end, you’ll understand how to connect your frontend to WordPress, securely fetch content, and display it dynamically—unlocking the flexibility and performance benefits of a decoupled architecture. Whether you’re new to headless CMS or looking to modernize your workflow, this guide will provide practical, real-world techniques you can apply to your own projects.

### Step 1: Set Up Your WordPress Backend

Before you start building a headless WordPress site, you need a solid backend foundation. This section covers the essential steps to set up your WordPress instance, ensure the REST API is available, and create sample content for testing. By preparing your backend properly, you’ll make it easy for your frontend application to fetch and display content seamlessly using the WordPress REST API.

1. **Install WordPress**:
   - Set up a WordPress instance locally (using Local by Flywheel) or on a hosting provider.
   - Install a lightweight theme like **Astra** to manage the backend (you won’t need it for the frontend).

2. **Enable the REST API**:
   - The WordPress REST API is enabled by default since version 4.7 (2016). Verify by visiting `your-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`.
   - Install the **WP REST API** plugin for additional endpoints if needed (optional).

3. **Create Sample Content**:
   - Add a few posts and pages in the WordPress dashboard to test API data.

### Step 2: Secure the WordPress Backend

Security is crucial when exposing your WordPress backend to the public, especially in a headless setup. By default, the REST API is accessible to anyone, which can lead to unauthorized access if not properly secured. This section outlines best practices for securing your WordPress backend, ensuring that only authenticated requests can access sensitive data while still allowing your frontend to fetch content.

- **Hide the Admin**: Use a plugin like **WPS Hide Login** to change the login URL (e.g., from `/wp-admin` to `/secret-login`).
- **Authentication**: For restricted endpoints, use JWT authentication (e.g., **JWT Authentication for WP REST API** plugin).
- **Disable Unnecessary Endpoints**: Use a plugin like **Disable REST API** to limit public access.

{/* TODO: *Example*: I secured a client’s headless WordPress backend with JWT, ensuring only authenticated requests accessed sensitive data. */}

---

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend (React Example)

To build a headless WordPress site, you need a modern frontend framework to consume the REST API and display content dynamically. In this example, we’ll use **React** as our frontend technology. React is a popular choice for building interactive user interfaces, and it works seamlessly with the WordPress REST API.

We’ll use **React** with **Create React App** for the frontend, hosted on **Vercel**.

1. **Install Node.js**:
   - Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a React App**:
   - Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app headless-wordpress
    cd headless-wordpress
    npm start
    ```
    This command sets up a new React application named `headless-wordpress` and starts the development server.

3. **Install Axios**:
   - Use Axios to fetch data from the WordPress REST API:

    ```bash
    npm install axios
    ```

---

### Step 4: Fetch WordPress Data

Fetching data from the WordPress REST API is the core of any headless WordPress project. In this section, you'll learn how to connect your React frontend to your WordPress backend and retrieve posts dynamically. We'll walk through creating a simple React component that fetches and displays blog posts using Axios, making it easy to render your WordPress content in a modern, decoupled frontend.

1. **Create a component to fetch and display posts. Replace `src/App.js` with:**

    ```javascript
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
    import axios from 'axios';
    import './App.css';

    function App() {
      const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
      const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

      useEffect(() => {
        axios.get('https://your-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts')
          .then(response => {
            setPosts(response.data);
            setLoading(false);
          })
          .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error fetching posts:', error);
            setLoading(false);
          });
      }, []);

      if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;

      return (
        <div className="App">
          <h1>My Headless WordPress Blog</h1>
          <div className="posts">
            {posts.map(post => (
              <div key={post.id} className="post">
                <h2>{post.title.rendered}</h2>
                <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.content.rendered }} />
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

    This code sets up a React component that fetches posts from your WordPress site using the REST API. It uses Axios to make the HTTP request and displays the posts once they are loaded.

2. **Update the API URL**:
   - Replace `https://your-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts` with your actual WordPress site URL.

3. **Run the React App**:
   - In your terminal, run:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This command starts the React development server, and you can view your app at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Add basic styles in `src/App.css`:**

    ```css
    .App {
      max-width: 800px;
      margin: 0 auto;
      padding: 20px;
    }
    .post {
      margin-bottom: 40px;
    }
    .post h2 {
      color: #333;
    }
    ```

{/* TODO: *Recommended GIF*: A clip showing the React app displaying WordPress posts. */}

### Step 5: Deploy the Frontend

Deploying your React frontend is the final step in making your headless WordPress site accessible to the world. In this section, you'll learn how to push your code to GitHub and deploy it using Vercel, a popular platform for hosting modern web applications. This process ensures your site is live, scalable, and benefits from features like automatic updates and global CDN delivery.

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Create a GitHub repository and push your React app.
   - Run:

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
    git push origin main
    ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel**:
   - Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
   - Import your GitHub repo and deploy with default settings.

{/* TODO: *Recommended Screenshot*: The Vercel dashboard showing a deployed React app. */}

### Step 6: Configure CORS (if needed)
If your React app is hosted on a different domain than your WordPress backend, you may need to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow requests from your frontend.

- **Install CORS Plugin**: Use the **CORS** plugin in WordPress to allow requests from your frontend domain.
- **Configure Allowed Origins**: Set the allowed origins to your React app's URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`).
- **Test CORS**: Ensure your React app can fetch data without CORS errors in the browser console.
- **Example CORS Configuration**: In the CORS plugin settings, add your frontend URL under "Allowed Origins".
```json
{
  "allowed_origins": [
    "https://your-app.vercel.app"
  ]
}
```

---

### Step 7: Test and Optimize

Testing and optimizing your headless WordPress site is essential to ensure a smooth user experience and robust performance. After deploying your frontend, take time to verify that all content loads correctly, the interface is responsive across devices, and there are no errors or bottlenecks. This step helps you catch issues early, improve site speed, and deliver a polished, professional product to your audience.

- **Test the Frontend**: Visit your deployed URL (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`) to see WordPress posts.
- **Check Responsiveness**: Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Optimize Performance**: Use lazy loading for images and minify assets with **Vite** (if you switch from Create React App).
