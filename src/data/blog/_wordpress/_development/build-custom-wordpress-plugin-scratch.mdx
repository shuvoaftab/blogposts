## Step-by-Step Guide to Building a WordPress Plugin

Before jumping into the code, let’s walk through the process of building a basic WordPress plugin step by step. This section will guide you from setting up your development environment to creating, activating, and testing your own plugin. By following along, you’ll gain hands-on experience with essential WordPress plugin concepts and best practices, making it easier to expand your skills for more advanced projects.

Let’s create a simple plugin called “My Custom Plugin” that adds a shortcode to display a welcome message. This example is beginner-friendly but scalable for more complex projects.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

Before you begin building your plugin, it’s essential to set up a reliable development environment. A proper setup ensures you can safely write, test, and debug your code without affecting a live website. This section will guide you through choosing the right tools and creating a local WordPress installation, so you can experiment freely and develop your plugin efficiently.

- Install a local WordPress instance using **Local by Flywheel** or **XAMPP**.
- Use a code editor like **VS Code** for writing PHP, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Back up your site if working on a live environment.

{/* TODO: *Recommended Screenshot*: A screenshot of Local by Flywheel or VS Code with a WordPress project open. */}

### Step 2: Create the Plugin Folder and Main File

Before you can start coding your custom WordPress plugin, you need to set up its basic structure. This involves creating a dedicated folder and a main PHP file that will contain your plugin’s code. These steps ensure WordPress can detect and manage your plugin from the dashboard. Follow the instructions below to get your plugin ready for development and activation.

1. Navigate to `wp-content/plugins/` in your WordPress installation.
2. Create a folder named `my-custom-plugin` (use lowercase, no spaces).
3. Inside the folder, create a file named `my-custom-plugin.php`.

### Step 3: Add the Plugin Header

Before WordPress can recognize and activate your plugin, you need to add a special comment block called the "plugin header" at the top of your main PHP file. This header provides WordPress with essential information about your plugin, such as its name, description, version, and author. Without this header, your plugin won’t appear in the WordPress dashboard. Let’s add the required header to your `my-custom-plugin.php` file.

In `my-custom-plugin.php`, add the following header to make WordPress recognize your plugin:

```php
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: My Custom Plugin
Plugin URI: https://yourwebsite.com/my-custom-plugin
Description: A simple plugin to add a custom welcome message shortcode.
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Your Name
Author URI: https://yourwebsite.com
License: GPL2
License URI: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
Text Domain: my-custom-plugin
*/
```

- **Plugin Name**: The name displayed in the WordPress dashboard.
- **Plugin URI**: A link to your plugin’s homepage (optional).
- **Description**: A brief description of what your plugin does.
- **Version**: The current version of your plugin.
- **Author**: Your name or your company’s name.
- **Author URI**: A link to your website or profile.
- **License**: The license under which your plugin is released (GPL2 is standard).
- **License URI**: A link to the license details.
- **Text Domain**: Used for translations, matches the plugin folder name.

### Step 4: Add a Basic Shortcode

Shortcodes are a powerful feature in WordPress that allow users to easily add dynamic content to posts and pages using simple bracketed codes. By creating your own shortcode, you can provide reusable functionality that anyone can insert without writing PHP. In this step, you’ll learn how to build a basic shortcode that outputs a custom welcome message, making your plugin interactive and user-friendly.

Let’s create a shortcode `[welcome_message]` that displays a customizable message. Add this to `my-custom-plugin.php`:

```php
// Register the welcome message shortcode
function mcp_welcome_message_shortcode( $atts ) {
    $atts = shortcode_atts( array(
        'message' => 'Welcome to my site!',
    ), $atts, 'welcome_message' );
    
    return '<div class="mcp-welcome">' . esc_html( $atts['message'] ) . '</div>';
}
add_shortcode( 'welcome_message', 'mcp_welcome_message_shortcode' );
```

- **shortcode_atts**: Allows users to customize the message (e.g., `[welcome_message message="Hello, visitors!"]`).
- **esc_html**: Sanitizes output to prevent security issues.
- **add_shortcode**: Registers the shortcode with WordPress.


### Step 5: Style the Shortcode Output

Styling your plugin’s output helps it blend seamlessly with your site’s design and improves user experience. By adding custom CSS, you can control the appearance of the welcome message or any other elements your plugin generates. In this step, you’ll learn how to create a dedicated stylesheet for your plugin and properly enqueue it so WordPress loads it only when needed.

Create a `css` folder inside `my-custom-plugin` and add a file named `style.css`. Add:

```css
.mcp-welcome {
    background-color: #f1f1f1;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 18px;
}
```

Enqueue the stylesheet in `my-custom-plugin.php`:

```php
// Enqueue plugin styles
function mcp_enqueue_styles() {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'mcp-style', plugin_dir_url( __FILE__ ) . 'css/style.css', array(), '1.0.0' );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'mcp_enqueue_styles' );
```

{/* TODO: *Recommended GIF*: A clip showing the shortcode `[welcome_message]` in a WordPress post, with the styled output. */}

### Step 6: Activate and Test the Plugin

Activating and testing your plugin is a crucial step to ensure it works as intended and integrates smoothly with your WordPress site. This process allows you to verify that your shortcode displays correctly, your styles are applied, and there are no conflicts with other plugins or themes. Follow these steps to activate your plugin and test its functionality in a safe environment before deploying it to a live site.

1. Go to `Plugins > Installed Plugins` in your WordPress dashboard.
2. Find “My Custom Plugin” and click “Activate.”
3. Add the shortcode `[welcome_message]` to a post or page.
4. Test on multiple devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.

{/* TODO: *Recommended Screenshot*: The Plugins page with “My Custom Plugin” activated. */}

### Step 7: Add Advanced Functionality (Optional)

Let's take your plugin to the next level by adding advanced features and customization options. One of the most valuable enhancements is creating an admin settings page, allowing users to change the default welcome message directly from the WordPress dashboard—no code editing required. This not only improves usability but also demonstrates how to leverage the WordPress Settings API for real-world plugin development.

#### Example: Add an Admin Settings Page to Customize the Default Message

By following these steps, you'll enable site administrators to set a custom default message for the `[welcome_message]` shortcode:

1. **Add a Settings Page:** Use the `add_options_page` function to create a new settings page under the "Settings" menu in the WordPress admin.
2. **Register the Setting:** Use the Settings API to register a new option for storing the default message.
3. **Create the Settings Form:** Build a form that lets users update the default message.
4. **Update the Shortcode:** Modify the shortcode to use the saved default message from the settings.

Below is the complete code to implement these features in your `my-custom-plugin.php` file:


```php
// Add settings menu
function mcp_add_admin_menu() {
    add_options_page( 'My Custom Plugin Settings', 'My Custom Plugin', 'manage_options', 'my-custom-plugin', 'mcp_settings_page' );
}
add_action( 'admin_menu', 'mcp_add_admin_menu' );

// Register settings
function mcp_settings_init() {
    register_setting( 'mcp_options_group', 'mcp_default_message' );
    add_settings_section( 'mcp_section', 'Plugin Settings', null, 'my-custom-plugin' );
    add_settings_field( 'mcp_default_message', 'Default Welcome Message', 'mcp_default_message_field', 'my-custom-plugin', 'mcp_section' );
}
add_action( 'admin_init', 'mcp_settings_init' );

function mcp_default_message_field() {
    $value = get_option( 'mcp_default_message', 'Welcome to my site!' );
    echo '<input type="text" name="mcp_default_message" value="' . esc_attr( $value ) . '" />';
}

function mcp_settings_page() {
    ?>
    <div class="wrap">
        <h1>My Custom Plugin Settings</h1>
        <form method="post" action="options.php">
            <?php
            settings_fields( 'mcp_options_group' );
            do_settings_sections( 'my-custom-plugin' );
            submit_button();
            ?>
        </form>
    </div>
    <?php
}
```

Update the shortcode to use the settings:

```php
function mcp_welcome_message_shortcode( $atts ) {
    $atts = shortcode_atts( array(
        'message' => get_option( 'mcp_default_message', 'Welcome to my site!' ),
    ), $atts, 'welcome_message' );
    return '<div class="mcp-welcome">' . esc_html( $atts['message'] ) . '</div>';
}
```
