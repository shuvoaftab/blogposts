## What is Dark Mode?

Dark mode (or night mode) is a UI option that replaces light backgrounds with darker tones, usually black or dark gray. It inverts or modifies the siteâ€™s color scheme to reduce the amount of white or light-emitting areas.

Itâ€™s typically optional, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes depending on their preference.

### Why Should You Add Dark Mode to Your WordPress Site?

* **Improved User Experience:** Many users find dark mode more comfortable, especially at night.
* **Reduced Eye Strain:** Darker backgrounds can reduce glare and fatigue.
* **Energy Efficiency:** OLED and AMOLED screens consume less power in dark mode.
* **Modern Appeal:** Dark UI is seen as stylish and futuristic.
* **Accessibility:** Dark mode helps people with visual impairments or light sensitivity.

### When Should You Enable Dark Mode?

* If your audience includes night readers (e.g., developers, gamers, readers)
* If your site is used across time zones
* When you want to offer a better mobile experience
* When your brand identity fits with a sleek, modern interface

### Who Is Dark Mode For?
