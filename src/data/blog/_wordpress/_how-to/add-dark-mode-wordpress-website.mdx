## Method 3: Add Dark Mode with Custom Code

If you’re comfortable with code, adding dark mode manually gives you complete flexibility over the design and user experience. This approach is ideal for developers who want to avoid extra plugins, ensure optimal performance, or tightly integrate dark mode with their site’s branding. By writing your own CSS and JavaScript, you can customize every aspect—from color palettes and transitions to toggle button placement and persistence of user preferences. 

You can also leverage the `prefers-color-scheme` media query to automatically match the user’s system settings, or provide a custom toggle for manual switching. While this method requires more effort and testing, it’s the best way to achieve a seamless, lightweight, and fully tailored dark mode implementation that works across all devices and browsers.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Enqueue Dark Mode CSS**

WordPress uses the `wp_enqueue_style` function to properly load CSS files on your site. This ensures that your styles are included in the correct order and only when needed, preventing conflicts and improving performance. By enqueuing your dark mode stylesheet, you make sure it integrates seamlessly with your theme and other plugins, following WordPress best practices for asset management.

```php
function enqueue_dark_mode_styles() {
  wp_enqueue_style('dark-mode', get_template_directory_uri() . '/dark-mode.css');
}
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'enqueue_dark_mode_styles');
```

2. **Write Dark Mode CSS** (e.g. `dark-mode.css`)

The CSS snippet above defines the visual appearance of your website when dark mode is active. By targeting `body.dark-mode`, it sets a dark background color (`#121212`) and light text color (`#f5f5f5`) to ensure readability in low-light environments. Additionally, it customizes link colors (`a { color: #bb86fc; }`) to provide sufficient contrast and maintain accessibility. This approach allows you to easily toggle between light and dark themes by simply adding or removing the `dark-mode` class from the `<body>` element.

```css
body.dark-mode {
  background-color: #121212;
  color: #f5f5f5;
}
a { color: #bb86fc; }
```

3. **Add Toggle Button with JavaScript**

```html
<button id="darkToggle">🌙 Toggle Dark Mode</button>
```
The JavaScript snippet attaches a click event listener to the button with the ID `darkToggle`. When the button is clicked, it toggles the `dark-mode` class on the `<body>` element. This simple approach allows users to switch between light and dark themes instantly, as the CSS rules for dark mode are applied or removed based on the presence of the `dark-mode` class. By using `classList.toggle`, the code ensures that the theme can be switched back and forth with each button press, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience without requiring a page reload.

```javascript
document.getElementById('darkToggle').addEventListener('click', () => {
  document.body.classList.toggle('dark-mode');
});
```

This is ideal for full control without relying on plugins.
