## Authentication Methods for WordPress REST API
The WordPress REST API supports various authentication methods to ensure secure access to your site’s data. Choosing the right authentication method depends on your use case, such as whether you’re building a mobile app, integrating with third-party services, or creating a custom frontend.

By default, the WordPress REST API allows public access to some endpoints (e.g., fetching posts). However, endpoints that require authentication, such as creating or updating content, need a secure authentication method.

### A. Cookie Authentication (Default for Logged-in Users)

When interacting with the WordPress REST API from within the same site or for logged-in users, cookie authentication is the default mechanism. This method leverages the user’s existing login session to authenticate API requests, making it seamless for internal operations but unsuitable for external or headless applications.

WordPress provides built-in cookie-based authentication, which works only for logged-in users with proper permissions.

#### Implementation

Ensure the user is logged in and authenticated:

```php
if (is_user_logged_in()) {
    $current_user = wp_get_current_user();
    echo 'Hello, ' . esc_html($current_user->display_name);
}
```

#### Limitations

- Only works for logged-in users.
- Not suitable for external applications.

### B. Application Passwords (Built-in Since WordPress 5.6)

Application passwords provide a simple and secure way for external applications to access the WordPress REST API without exposing a user's main login credentials. Introduced in WordPress 5.6, this feature enables users to generate unique passwords for each application, making it easier to manage and revoke access as needed.

Application passwords allow external applications to authenticate securely without requiring user credentials.

#### Implementation
1. Go to **Users > Your Profile**.
2. Scroll to **Application Passwords**.
3. Generate a new password and use it in API requests.

#### Usage Example

Make a request with Basic Authentication:

```sh
curl -u username:application_password -X GET "https://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"
```

#### Limitations
- Lacks granular permissions control.
- Passwords should be stored securely.

### C. JWT Authentication (Recommended for Secure API Access)

JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is a modern, stateless method for securing API requests. It enables secure, token-based authentication between clients and your WordPress site, making it ideal for mobile apps, headless frontends, and third-party integrations. JWT tokens are compact, self-contained, and easy to use for secure API access.

JWT (JSON Web Token) provides a secure way to authenticate users and applications.

#### Installation

Install the JWT Authentication plugin:
```sh
composer require firebase/php-jwt
```

#### Generate a JWT Token

Make a request to get a token:
```sh
curl -X POST https://example.com/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token \
     -d "username=admin&password=yourpassword"
```

Use the token for authenticated requests:
```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" -X GET "https://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"
```

#### Benefits
- Secure token-based authentication.
- Works well for mobile and third-party applications.
- Stateless and scalable for distributed systems.
- Easy to revoke or refresh tokens.
- Reduces risk of credential leakage.
- Compatible with modern authentication flows (e.g., Single Page Apps, mobile clients).

### D. OAuth 2.0 (For Enterprise-level Security)

OAuth 2.0 provides a robust authentication framework, ideal for large-scale applications.

#### Setup Process
1. Install the **OAuth 2.0 Server Plugin**.
2. Register your application.
3. Obtain an access token via authorization flow.

#### Usage
Send a request using the obtained token:
```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" -X GET "https://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"
```

#### Benefits
- Ideal for multi-user authentication.
- Granular permission control.
- Secure access for third-party applications.
- Supports delegated access without sharing user credentials.
- Widely adopted and compatible with many platforms.
- Enables integration with enterprise identity providers (SSO).
- Allows for token revocation and expiration for enhanced security.

## Restricting REST API Access

Besides authentication, you can limit API access by restricting public endpoints. Consider the following strategies to further secure your REST API:

- **Restrict by IP Address**: Limit API access to specific IP addresses or ranges using server-level rules (e.g., in `.htaccess` or NGINX config).
- **Custom Capability Checks**: Add custom permission checks to sensitive endpoints to ensure only users with specific roles or capabilities can access them.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks on your API endpoints.
- **Disable Unused Endpoints**: Remove or disable endpoints that are not required for your application to reduce the attack surface.
- **Whitelist Applications**: Allow only approved applications or domains to interact with your API using CORS headers or application-level checks.

### A. Restrict REST API to Logged-in Users

Restricting the WordPress REST API to logged-in users is a straightforward way to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and actions. By enforcing authentication for all API requests, you ensure that only users with valid credentials can interact with your site's endpoints, significantly reducing the risk of data leaks or malicious activity.

```php
function restrict_rest_api_access($access) {
    if (!is_user_logged_in()) {
        return new WP_Error('rest_forbidden', __('You need to be logged in to access this API.'), ['status' => 401]);
    }
    return $access;
}
add_filter('rest_authentication_errors', 'restrict_rest_api_access');
```

### B. Disable Specific REST API Endpoints

Disabling specific REST API endpoints allows you to minimize your site's attack surface by exposing only the functionality you actually need. By removing unnecessary or sensitive endpoints—such as those that reveal user data—you can reduce the risk of unauthorized access, data leaks, and other security vulnerabilities.

```php
function disable_wp_rest_endpoints($endpoints) {
    unset($endpoints['/wp/v2/users']);
    return $endpoints;
}
add_filter('rest_endpoints', 'disable_wp_rest_endpoints');
```
