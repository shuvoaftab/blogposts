If you're reading this, chances are your WordPress site has been hacked — or you suspect it might have been. Either way, you’re not alone. According to recent reports, **over 90% of all hacked websites run on WordPress** , and the reasons vary- outdated plugins, weak passwords, vulnerable themes, and brute force attacks.

But here’s the good news- getting hacked doesn’t mean game over. With the right steps, you can recover your site, restore your content, and even strengthen its security for the future.

In this comprehensive guide, I’ll walk you through:-
- How to detect a hack
- Immediate actions to take
- Step-by-step cleanup process
- Tools and plugins to help secure your site
- Real-world examples and use cases
- Common mistakes to avoid

I’ve helped dozens of clients recover from hacked WordPress sites — some had malware injections, others were blacklisted by Google, and a few even had their admin accounts hijacked. The key is to act fast, stay calm, and follow a clear plan.

Let’s get started.

## First Aid Implementation

### Confirm That Your Site Is Actually Hacked

Before jumping into panic mode, make sure what you're seeing is indeed a hack. Here are common signs:

- Your homepage redirects to an adult or phishing site
- You see unfamiliar pop-ups or ads
- Search engines warn visitors that your site is unsafe
- Unknown users appear in your WordPress dashboard
- Your site suddenly loads extremely slowly or crashes frequently

> 🚨 Pro Tip: Use tools like [Google Safe Browsing](https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/overview) or [Sucuri SiteCheck](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/) to scan your site for malware.

### Put Your Site in Maintenance Mode

The last thing you want is for visitors to land on a hacked version of your site. Putting your blog in maintenance mode prevents further damage and protects your audience.

#### Option 1: Use a Plugin (Recommended)

Install a plugin like **WP Maintenance Mode** or **Coming Soon Page & Maintenance Mode by SeedProd**. These let you display a professional-looking maintenance page while you work behind the scenes.

#### Option 2: Manual Method

Add this code snippet to your theme’s `functions.php` file:

```php
function wp_maintenance_mode() {
    if (!current_user_can('edit_themes') || !is_user_logged_in()) {
        wp_die('<h1>Maintenance in Progress</h1><p>We are currently working on our site. Please check back soon.</p>');
    }
}
add_action('get_header', 'wp_maintenance_mode');
```

> ⚠️ Don't forget to remove this once the cleanup is complete!

### Change All Passwords Immediately

Changing all your passwords is one of the most critical first steps after a hack. Hackers often gain access through weak or reused credentials, and may have compromised multiple accounts. By resetting every password associated with your site, you immediately cut off any unauthorized access and prevent further damage.

This includes:
- WordPress admin account
- FTP/SFTP login
- Database user credentials
- Hosting control panel (cPanel, Plesk, etc.)

Use strong passwords — ideally generated by a password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password.

> 🔒 Best Practice: Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your WordPress login using plugins like **Duo Two-Factor Authentication** or **Google Authenticator – Login Verification**.

### Scan for Malware and Vulnerabilities

Scanning your WordPress site for malware and vulnerabilities is crucial to identify the full extent of the hack. Even if the symptoms seem minor, hidden backdoors or malicious code can persist. Use both automated and manual methods to detect infected files and ensure your site is completely clean before moving forward.

#### Automated Scanning Tools:
- **Wordfence Security** – Free and premium versions available; scans core files, themes, and plugins.
- **Sucuri SiteCheck** – Online scanner that checks for malware, defacements, and SEO spam.
- **iThemes Security Pro** – Offers real-time scanning and hardening features.
- **MalCare** – A cloud-based scanner that can detect malware without slowing down your site.

#### Manual Inspection Tips:
- Check recently modified files using FTP or cPanel
- Look for obfuscated PHP code like `eval(gzinflate(base64_decode(...)))`
- Review your database for suspicious entries in the `wp_options`, `wp_posts`, or `wp_comments` tables
- Check for unfamiliar plugins or themes in your WordPress dashboard
- Look for any suspicious JavaScript files in your theme or plugin directories
- Use the **WP-CLI** command line tool to check for file changes:
  ```bash
  wp core verify-checksums
  ```
- Use the **Better Search Replace** plugin to find and replace any malicious URLs in your database.

### Restore From a Clean Backup

Restoring your site from a clean backup is often the fastest and safest way to recover after a hack. This process ensures you’re starting from a known good state, eliminating hidden malware or backdoors that may be difficult to detect manually. Always verify your backup is clean before proceeding.

If you have a recent backup that predates the hack, now is the time to restore it.

#### Recommended Backup Plugins:
- **UpdraftPlus** – Easy-to-use, supports cloud storage
- **BackupBuddy** – More advanced but powerful
- **VaultPress (by Automattic)** – Great for automatic backups
- **BlogVault** – Offers real-time backups and one-click restore

> 📁 Always restore backups to a new database to prevent reinfection.

### Update Everything

Keeping your WordPress installation, plugins, and themes up to date is essential for security. Hackers often exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software, so regular updates close these security gaps and help protect your site from future attacks. Don’t skip this step, even if everything seems to be working fine.

Outdated software is one of the biggest causes of WordPress hacks. Make sure to update:

- WordPress core
- All plugins
- Themes (including parent and child themes)
- PHP version (if outdated)

You can do this manually via FTP or through the WordPress dashboard under:
- **Dashboard > Updates**

> 🔄 Important: Some plugins may break after updates — test on a staging site first if possible.

### Remove Suspicious Users and Roles

Hackers often create fake admin accounts to regain access later. Go to **Users > All Users** and delete any unfamiliar accounts.

Also, ensure no user has unnecessary administrator privileges.

### Secure Your Server and Files

Securing your server and file system is a crucial step in preventing future hacks and ensuring your WordPress site remains protected. Even after cleaning up, vulnerabilities at the server level can leave your site exposed. Take the time to harden your hosting environment and follow these best practices:

Your hosting environment plays a big role in security. Take these steps:

- Set proper file permissions:
  - Folders: `755`
  - Files: `644`
- Disable directory browsing by adding this to `.htaccess`:
  ```apache
  Options -Indexes
  ```
- Protect your `wp-config.php` file by moving it outside the web root (if possible)
- Use SSH keys instead of passwords for server access

### Rebuild Your Sitemap and Notify Search Engines

After successfully cleaning and securing your WordPress site, it’s important to address your site’s visibility in search engines. Hackers often inject spammy or malicious URLs that can harm your SEO and reputation. Rebuilding your sitemap and notifying search engines ensures your site is re-crawled and any harmful links are removed.

After cleaning up your site, rebuild your sitemap using an SEO plugin like Yoast or Rank Math. Then submit it to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools to request re-indexing.

This helps remove any malicious URLs from search results .
