WordPress is the leading Content Management System (CMS) globally, powering over 60% of all websites that use a CMS since its initial release on May 27, 2003. Its popularity stems from its flexibility, extensive plugin ecosystem, and user-friendly interface, making it suitable for everyone from beginners to experienced developers. However, like any complex software, WordPress websites can encounter a variety of issues—ranging from plugin conflicts and theme errors to server misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities. 

These problems can disrupt site functionality, impact user experience, or even cause financial loss if not addressed promptly. Effective troubleshooting is essential to quickly identify and resolve such issues. In this guide, we will explore a systematic approach to diagnosing common WordPress and WooCommerce problems, using built-in tools, browser features, and best practices. By following these steps, you can minimize downtime and maintain a healthy, high-performing website.

## Enable Browser Console

The first step to check for an issue that occurred on any of the web pages and also some other details regarding the Webserver, Network, Architecture, and other factors that runs or operates the website is to enable the Browser Console and check for initial hints.

To do this, please use ****⌘ +**** **Option + J (on macOS), or **CTRL +**** **Shift + J (on Windows/Linux)** from the keyboard which will open the browser console in the same window or in a new window if you have detached the window earlier.

You can also open the Developer Tools by clicking anywhere on the web page and Clicking on Inspect as shown in the picture. The shortcut for this is ****⌘ +**** **Option + I (on macOS), or **CTRL +**** **Shift + I (on Windows/Linux)**. This opens up the Elements Tab and then you will need to switch to the Console Tab.

Browser Console in the same window looks similar to the below screenshot:

The Console Tab (highlighted by the red box) is a crucial tool in your browser’s developer tools, typically found alongside other tabs like Elements, Network, and Sources. It allows developers to interact directly with a web page’s JavaScript environment. Within the Console Tab, the Console Logs area (marked by the blue box) displays real-time output such as warnings, errors, and informational messages generated by the website’s scripts. These logs are invaluable for troubleshooting, as they can reveal issues like syntax errors, failed network requests, or deprecated API usage. By examining the messages in the Console Logs, you can often pinpoint the source of a problem, understand its context, and take steps to resolve it. 

Additionally, you can type JavaScript commands directly into the console to inspect variables, test code snippets, or manipulate the page’s state, making it an essential resource for debugging and development.

## Check for HTTP Headers

Another advanced way to gather troubleshooting information is by examining the HTTP headers using your browser’s Developer Tools, specifically the "**Network**" tab. Start by opening the Developer Tools and navigating to the Network tab before reloading the page. This tab logs all network requests made by the browser as the page loads. Look for the main request (usually the first entry or the one matching your site’s URL), then click on it to reveal detailed information in the right pane. Select the **Headers** sub-tab to view both the request and response headers.

HTTP headers provide valuable insights into how your server and website are configured. For example, you can check the status code, server type, caching policies, security headers, and cookies. Identifying missing or misconfigured headers can help diagnose issues related to performance, security, or compatibility. This information is often requested by support teams to better understand your site’s environment and troubleshoot effectively.

</figure>

The HTTP headers are divided into two sections: **General** and **Response Headers**. The General section contains basic information about the request, while the Response Headers section provides detailed information about the server's response to that request.

### General Headers

The general section contains a few primary information about the website as described below:

- **Request URL:** The web page where the developer tools were opened. _Example: **https://www.google.com/**_

- **Request Method:** The HTTP Request Method. _Example: **GET**_

- **Status Code:** The HTTP status code. _Example: **200**_

- **Remote Address:** The IP address resolved the domain including the Port for HTTP or HTTPS. _Example: **142.250.206.164:443**_

- **Referrer Policy:** This header defines how much referrer information should be included with requests. _Example: **origin**_

There are various types of headers that are responses against the requests a browser made to the server to load the web page.

## Check Site Health from WordPress

WordPress provides a built-in Site Health tool that helps you monitor the overall status and performance of your website. This feature highlights critical issues, recommended improvements, and important configuration details related to security, performance, and server environment. By regularly reviewing the Site Health status, you can proactively identify potential problems, ensure your site is running optimally, and address any issues before they impact visitors. This tool is especially useful when troubleshooting unexpected behavior or preparing to contact support.

### Site Health

To check your site's health in WordPress, navigate to **Tools > Site Health** from your WordPress dashboard. This section provides a comprehensive overview of your website’s current status. 

On the **Status** tab, WordPress automatically scans your site for critical issues, recommended improvements, and configuration details that may affect performance, security, or functionality. Here, you’ll see a summary of any detected problems, along with actionable recommendations to resolve them. Common checks include verifying HTTPS usage, plugin and theme updates, PHP version compatibility, and REST API availability.

Review the list of issues and follow the suggested steps to address them. If you’re experiencing problems or preparing to contact support, you can copy the diagnostic information provided here to share with your hosting provider or developer. Regularly monitoring the Site Health page helps ensure your WordPress site remains secure, fast, and reliable.

This status tab reports if there are any critical issues that the Administrator should look into or will recommend a few other options for Performance and Securities improvements.

### Info

The Info tab is organized into several categories, each providing detailed technical information about your WordPress installation and hosting environment. Key sections include:

- **WordPress:** Displays version, language, site URLs, permalink structure, multisite status, registration settings, and other core configuration details.
- **Directories and Sizes:** Shows the paths and sizes of important directories like uploads, plugins, and themes.
- **Active Theme:** Lists the currently active theme, its version, and author information.
- **Plugins:** Provides a list of all installed plugins, their versions, and activation status.
- **Media Handling:** Details about image editors, supported file types, and server capabilities for media uploads.
- **Server:** Contains information about the server operating system, web server software, PHP version, memory limits, and other server-level settings.
- **Database:** Shows the database type, version, and table prefix.
- **WordPress Constants:** Lists important constants defined in your wp-config.php file, such as WP_DEBUG and WP_MEMORY_LIMIT.
- **Filesystem Permissions:** Reports on the write permissions for key directories.

These categories help you and support teams quickly assess your website’s technical environment, identify potential misconfigurations, and gather the necessary data for troubleshooting complex issues.
