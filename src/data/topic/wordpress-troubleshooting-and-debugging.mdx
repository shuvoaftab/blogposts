## 2. Collecting Troubleshooting Data
Before you can fix any WordPress issue, you need to understand exactly what’s happening. Collecting the right troubleshooting data is the foundation of effective problem-solving. By gathering details about your site’s environment, recent changes, and the specific symptoms you’re seeing, you’ll save time and avoid guesswork. This step ensures you have all the information needed to diagnose issues accurately—whether you’re working alone or seeking help from support forums or professionals. Good data collection leads to faster, more reliable fixes and helps prevent the same problems from recurring in the future.

Start by gathering clues to pinpoint problems.

### 2.1 What to Collect
- **Environment**: WordPress version, PHP version, hosting details.
- **Symptoms**: Error messages, when/where it happens.
- **Logs**: Check error logs, access logs.
- **Changes**: Recent updates, new plugins/themes.

### 2.2 How to Gather
- **Site Health**: Dashboard > Tools > Site Health for stats.
- **Plugins**: List active ones, note recent installs.
- **Logs**: Access via hosting (cPanel) or WP-CLI: `wp db query "SELECT * FROM wp_options LIMIT 5"`.
- **Browser**: Check console (F12) for JS errors.
- **Guide**: See [Collect WordPress Troubleshooting Data](/posts/collect-wordpress-troubleshooting-data/) for a checklist.

> **Pro Tip**: Screenshot errors and note exact times—key for diagnosis!

## 3. Enabling Debugging in WordPress
Debug mode reveals hidden issues.

Enabling debugging in WordPress is a crucial step for uncovering the root causes of site problems. By default, WordPress hides many errors and warnings to avoid confusing users, but this can make troubleshooting difficult. Turning on debug mode allows you to see detailed error messages, log issues to a file, and track down the exact source of bugs or conflicts. Whether you're dealing with a blank screen, plugin malfunction, or mysterious slowdowns, enabling debugging gives you the visibility needed to diagnose and resolve issues efficiently. In this section, you'll learn how to safely activate WordPress debugging and use its tools to streamline your troubleshooting process.

### 3.1 Turn On Debugging
- **Steps**:
  1. Edit `wp-config.php` (via FTP or cPanel).
  2. Add:
     ```
     define('WP_DEBUG', true);
     define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
     define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
     ```
  3. Save—logs go to `wp-content/debug.log`.
- **Why**: Logs PHP errors, warnings.

### 3.2 Tools
- **Query Monitor**: Plugin to track queries, hooks, slow spots.
- **Log Viewer**: Use “Debug Log Manager” to read logs.
- **Test**: Reproduce the issue, check `debug.log`.
