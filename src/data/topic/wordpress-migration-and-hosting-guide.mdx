## 1. Understanding WordPress Migration
Migrating a WordPress site involves transferring all your website’s content, files, and database from one hosting environment to another. This process can seem daunting, especially if you’re concerned about downtime, data loss, or technical hiccups. However, understanding the basics of migration is the first step toward a smooth transition. Whether you’re moving to a faster host, changing your domain, or scaling up for more traffic, a well-planned migration ensures your site remains accessible and fully functional throughout the process. In this section, we’ll break down what WordPress migration means, why it’s necessary, and what components are involved so you can approach your move with confidence.

Migration moves your WordPress site—files, database, and settings—to a new host or domain.

### 1.1 Why Migrate?
- **Better Hosting**: Faster, cheaper, or more reliable host.
- **Domain Change**: Switch to a new URL (e.g., oldsite.com to newsite.com).
- **Scaling**: Support growing traffic.
- **Security**: Move after a hack or to a safer host.

### 1.2 Migration Components
- **Files**: In `public_html` (e.g., `wp-content`, `wp-config.php`).
- **Database**: Stores posts, settings (MySQL).
- **DNS**: Points domain to new host.
- **SSL**: Ensures HTTPS continuity.
